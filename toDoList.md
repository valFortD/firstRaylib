- Adding 2Dmode

- Problem with the random platforms that generate too close to each other, maybe create platform spacing?

- Problem with the ball's collision on the bottom part of the platform = Problem fixed

- Problem when the ball is on the edge on the platform it does not fall smoothly = by changing the collision method to "CheckCollisionRecs" it handle the side collision better and the ball fall more smoothly. However the distance before it fall still seems a bit wider, less smooth. 

- There is a delay when pressed spacebar, the ball jump is not smooth like before
